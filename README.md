**G**ary **B**ryson **L**uis **Jr.** on GitHub, just simply call me Gary, or GBL.

GBLodb stands for **G**ary **B**ryson **L**uis **o**n **d**a **b**eat, don't judge me, I just came up with it all of a sudden.

Personal blog repository: [GBLodb/the-notion](https://github.com/GBLodb/the-notion), could have some updates anytime.

Modded Minecraft plaer, SQUARE ENIX/4A player, former director of many Modded Minecraft related projects/organizations.

Adobe softwares user, PolyMC user, ArchLinux/Win10WIP user, Steam/UbiConnect/Epic user.

Fake CraftTweaker/IntelliJ IDEA/Rider/CLion user, bad ZenScript/Java/Python/Kotlin/Rust/CSharp/Ada learner.

Learning Unity3D recently, haven't thought of a great indie game idea.

Also learning Scala, Hadoop, multiple filesystems and databases, ApacheStack(Spark, Hive, Kafka, etc.), going further and further on the road of becoming a data scientist.

Yes I'm still watching TensorFlow/Torch courses and really interested in machine learning but god do I hate writing algorithms in Python.

No Minecraft-related development work will take place for the foreseeable future.
