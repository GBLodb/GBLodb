**G**ary **B**ryson **L**uis **Jr.** on GitHub, just simply call me Gary, or GBL.

GBLodb stands for **G**ary **B**ryson **L**uis **o**n **d**a **b**eat, don't judge me, I just came up with it all of a sudden.

Modded Minecraft player and 1.12.2 modpacker/modder, Majsoul player, SQUARE ENIX/4A player, Adobe softwares user, MultiMC user, ArchLinux/Win10WIP user, Steam/UbiConnect/Epic user.

Fake CraftTweaker/IntelliJ IDEA/Rider/CLion user, bad ZenScript/Java/Python/Kotlin/Rust/CSharp learner. However if you're **that** helpless that you wanna ask me to write some code for you, I won't refuse if I got the time and the mood.

Learning Unity3D recently, haven't thought of a great indie game idea.

Minecraft modpacker and modder with zero modpack or mod published, nobody cares what so ever.

Lead dev of the [Herodotus](https://github.com/ProjectHDS/Herodotus) modpack, and the head of [ProjectHDS](https://github.com/ProjectHDS).
